Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in Social and Political Sciences at Bocconi University. 

My research focuses on current challenges of democratic societies in Western Europe and in the US. I study the demand and supply of populism, electoral responses to immigration and emotions in politics. I am particuarly interested in understanding how globalization affects voters' preferences and how political elites act strategically to contend with potential disruptions. A general trait of my research is the attempt to substantiate well identified claims of causality, and to formulate theory to make sense of the data. I am interested in quantitative methods, and in particular in causal inference in the context of observational research, with both traditional and new sources of data. I am particularly intrigued by the potential of computational social science in opening new ways to understand political research.

My research has been supported by [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/Programs/PhD/), [Fondazione Invernizzi](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/Programs/PhD/PARAGRAFO+12+3+HANDBOOK+Special+financial+support+for+PhD+candidates+and+PhD+fellows), [Fondazione Banca del Monte di Lombardia](http://www.fbml.it/progetto-professionalit√†-IT.aspx) and [Ermenegildo Zegna Founder's Scholarship](http://www.zegnagroup.com/it/ez-founders-scholarship). I previously studied Economics and Political Science at Bocconi University, SciencesPo Paris and the College of Europe. 


This fall, you can meet me at the [Harvard University](https://economics.harvard.edu/people/gloria-gennaro). I will also present my work at [APSA Annual Meeting](https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/apsa/apsa19/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Person&selected_people_id=10113474&PHPSESSID=fnfrgqtvffrqdvv7ll1rf6gb36), at the [2nd Annual Conference on Politics and Computational Social Science (PaCSS) ](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/PaCSS) and at the [Brunek Workshop on Political Economy](https://wspoleco.events.unibz.it).
