Welcome! I am a PostDoc at the [Immigration Policy Lab](https://immigrationlab.org), at ETH Zurich.

My research focuses on current challenges of democratic societies in Western Europe and in the US. I study the demand and supply of populism, electoral responses to immigration and emotions in politics. I am particuarly interested in understanding how globalization affects voters' preferences and how political elites act strategically to contend with potential disruptions. 

A general trait of my research is the attempt to substantiate well identified claims of causality, and to formulate theory to make sense of the data. I am interested in quantitative methods, and in particular in causal inference in the context of observational research, with both traditional and new sources of data. I am particularly intrigued by the potential of computational social science in opening new ways to understand political research.

I received my PhD in Public Policy and Administration at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/programs/phd/PhD+in+Public+Policy+and+Administration/). During my PhD, I visited [NYU](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/sociology.html) and [Harvard University](https://economics.harvard.edu). This was only possible thanks to generous funding by [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/Programs/PhD/), [Fondazione Invernizzi](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/Programs/PhD/PARAGRAFO+12+3+HANDBOOK+Special+financial+support+for+PhD+candidates+and+PhD+fellows), [Fondazione Banca del Monte di Lombardia](http://www.fbml.it/progetto-professionalit√†-IT.aspx) and [Ermenegildo Zegna Founder's Scholarship](http://www.zegnagroup.com/it/ez-founders-scholarship). I also attended the 2019 [EITM Summer Institute](http://eitm.emory.edu) and the 2018 [Oxford Spring School in Advanced Research Methods](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/spring-school/spring-school.html).
