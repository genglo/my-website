abstract: Political rhetoric is central to the functioning of liberal democracy. On the traditional enlightenment view of a deliberative discourse, rhetoric serves the goals of representation and deliberation on objectives and means among an educated elite. On a more realist note, rhetoric can serve to persuade, mobilize, or deceive voters and other political actors. These old questions of how emotion and reason serve the goals of the politician and the needs of the polity remain actively contested by political theorists. These theoretical debates can be informed by empirical evidence. In recent years political scientists have begun to apply principles and methods from cognitive and affective psychology to understand empirically the roles of emotion and reason in politics. Therefore emotionality can be used strategically to persuade or mobilize voters. This project aims to analyze empirically the use of emotion and reason by politicians. The empirical context is the two houses of U.S. Congress for the years 1858 through 2016. Our measures of rhetoric are constructed from the text of parliamentary speeches published in the U.S. Congressional Record. Applying technologies from computational linguistics, we form scales of cognitive/deliberative rhetoric, on the one hand, and emotive/affective rhetoric on the other. With these measures of emotion and reason in political speech, we ask a number of questions about the rhetoric of U.S. Congressmen. How has the use of emotion and reason changed in Congress over the last two centuries? Does the emotional quality of rhetoric vary by gender or by political party? Does the use of emotional speech respond to electoral pressures and media exposure?
